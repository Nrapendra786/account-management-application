## Use Case: Salesforce Account Management API

# Scenario:
  You are tasked with creating a Spring Boot application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) 
  Salesforce/LocalDB Accounts through a RESTful API. The API will authenticate with Salesforce using OAuth 2.0 and interact 
  with the Salesforce REST API to manage account records.

## Features:
1) Authenticate with Salesforce using OAuth 2.0.
2) CRUD operations on Salesforce Account objects:
   # 1) Create: Add a new Account in Salesforce/LocalDB.
   # 2) Read: Retrieve Account details from Salesforce/LocalDB.
   # 3) Update: Modify an existing Account in Salesforce/LocalDB.
   # 4) Delete: Remove an Account from Salesforce/LocalDB.

## Required Setup:
    #  1) Salesforce Connected App: You need to create a Connected App in Salesforce to obtain the Client ID and Client Secret.
    #  2) Salesforce API Enabled: Ensure your Salesforce org has API access.
    #  3) Security Token: Obtain the security token from your Salesforce account if needed.  

## Steps to Implement
# 1. Create Salesforce Connected App:
     # Go to Setup â†’ App Manager in Salesforce.
     # Create a new Connected App and configure OAuth settings:
     # Enable OAuth Settings.
     # Add OAuth Scopes like api and refresh_token.
     # Set Callback URL to something like http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback (this is used in the authorization process).
# 2. Spring Boot Project Setup:
    # Spring Web for building the REST API.
    # Spring Boot Starter Security for managing authentication.
    # Spring Boot Starter OAuth2 for OAuth 2.0 support.
    # Apache HttpClient to make HTTP requests to Salesforce.

## 3. Configuration for Salesforce OAuth 2.0:
    #  Add your Salesforce Client ID, Client Secret, and other configuration details to your application.properties:

## 4. Salesforce OAuth 2.0 Authentication Service:
    #  Create a service that will authenticate with Salesforce using OAuth 2.0 and get the access token.

## 5. Salesforce Account Service (CRUD Operations):
    #  This service will handle CRUD operations using the Salesforce REST API and the access token obtained from the authentication service.

## Running the Application:
Run the Spring Boot application on your local machine using command
  mvn spring-boot:run
# Use tools like Postman to test the APIs.
## Testing the API Endpoints:
     # Create Account: POST /api/salesforce/accounts?name=TestAccount
     # Get Account: GET /api/salesforce/accounts/{id}
     # Update Account: PUT /api/salesforce/accounts/{id}?name=NewAccountName
     # Delete Account: DELETE /api/salesforce/accounts/{id}
     # This is a basic structure for integrating Salesforce with a Spring Boot application. You can expand it further to handle additional objects, handle pagination, add logging, and manage error handling.
