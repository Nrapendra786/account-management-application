# Use Case: Salesforce Account Management API

# Scenario:
  You are tasked with creating a Spring Boot application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) 
  Salesforce/LocalDB Accounts through a RESTful API. The API will authenticate with Salesforce using OAuth 2.0 and interact 
  with the Salesforce REST API to manage account records.

# Features:
1) Authenticate with Salesforce using OAuth 2.0.
2) CRUD operations on Salesforce Account objects:
    1) Create: Add a new Account in Salesforce/LocalDB.
    2) Read: Retrieve Account details from Salesforce/LocalDB.
    3) Update: Modify an existing Account in Salesforce/LocalDB.
    4) Delete: Remove an Account from Salesforce/LocalDB.

# Required Setup:
    1) Salesforce Connected App: You need to create a Connected App in Salesforce to obtain the Client ID and Client Secret.
    2) Salesforce API Enabled: Ensure your Salesforce org has API access.
    3) Security Token: Obtain the security token from your Salesforce account if needed.  

# Steps to Implement
  1. Create Salesforce Connected App:
     1) Go to Setup â†’ App Manager in Salesforce.
     2) Create a new Connected App and configure OAuth settings:
     3) Enable OAuth Settings.
     4) Add OAuth Scopes like api and refresh_token.
     5) Set Callback URL to something like http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback (this is used in the authorization process).
  2. Spring Boot Project Setup:
     1) Spring Web for building the REST API.
     2) Spring Boot Starter Security for managing authentication.
     3) Spring Boot Starter OAuth2 for OAuth 2.0 support.
     4) Apache HttpClient to make HTTP requests to Salesforce.

  3. Configuration for Salesforce OAuth 2.0:
     1) Add your Salesforce Client ID, Client Secret, and other configuration details to your application.properties:

  4. Salesforce OAuth 2.0 Authentication Service:
     1) Create a service that will authenticate with Salesforce using OAuth 2.0 and get the access token.

  5. Salesforce Account Service (CRUD Operations):
     1)  This service will handle CRUD operations using the Salesforce REST API and the access token obtained from the authentication service.

## Running the Application:
   Run the Spring Boot application on your local machine using following command : <br /> 
    mvn spring-boot:run
# Use tools like Postman to test the APIs.
## Testing the API Endpoints:
     1) Create Account: POST /api/salesforce/accounts?name=TestAccount
     2) Get Account: GET /api/salesforce/accounts/{id}
     3) Update Account: PUT /api/salesforce/accounts/{id}?name=NewAccountName
     4) Delete Account: DELETE /api/salesforce/accounts/{id}
     5) This is a basic structure for integrating Salesforce with a Spring Boot application. You can expand it further to handle additional objects, handle pagination, add logging, and manage error handling.
